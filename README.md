You can run the application from the command line using:

mvn spring-boot:run
Or you can build a single executable JAR file that contains all the necessary dependencies, classes, and resources with:

mvn clean package
Then you can run the JAR file with:

java -jar target/*.jar
Instead of mvn you can also use the maven-wrapper ./mvnw to ensure you have everything necessary to run the Maven build.
